# Java Solutions

This repository contains Java implementations of popular algorithmic problems. It showcases my understanding of recursion, backtracking, and sorting techniques.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `backtrack/` – Solutions using backtracking (e.g., permutations, combinations)
- `recursion/` – Recursive approaches to classic problems
- `sortings/` – Java implementations of sorting algorithms

## 🧠 Highlights

- Java used as the primary language
- Focus on clean logic and readability

## 🚀 How to Run

Each file is self-contained. You can run them using any Java IDE or command line:
```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
